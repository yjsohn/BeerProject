# enterance.html
It's a website that shows beers from some kinds of brands that I love, such as blanc, heineken, hoegaarden, and etc.
It's now impossible to open up this web, because the server where I uploaded this web has disappeared after the course ends. (I made this in my course 'Internet & Web') So I just upload my codes to share.

You should open up 'enterance.html' first and from there, you can choose beers that you are interested in.
